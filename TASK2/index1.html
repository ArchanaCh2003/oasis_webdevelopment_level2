        <p>Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 - 1 February 2003) 
           was an Indian-born American astronaut and mechanical 
           engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to
           go to space. She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia
           in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic 
           arm operator.Her second flight was on STS-107, the final 
           flight of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003. Chawla was one 
           of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle 
           Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during 
           its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003. 
           Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal 
           of Honor, and several streets, universities, and institutions 
           have been named in her honor. She is regarded as a national 
           hero in India.</p><br>
           <br>
           <p>In 1988, Chawla began working at NASA Ames Research Center, 
            where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical
             and/or short take-off and landing concepts. Much of Chawla's research 
             is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she 
             joined Overset Methods, Inc. as vice president and Research Scientist
              specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla
               held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders 
               and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes,
                seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in
                 April 1991, Chawla applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps. She joined 
                 the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1997</p>
